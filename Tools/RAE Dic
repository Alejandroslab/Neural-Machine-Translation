in Debian you could have some problems as this
error may appear:

"perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
LANGUAGE = (unset),
LC_ALL = (unset),
LANG = "en_US.utf8" "

solution:
in Debian open:

sudo vi .bashrc

go to the last row and add these two lines:

export LC_ALL=en_US.utf8
export LANGUAGE=en_US.utf8

DONE!
